Ryan Marshall's Homework 4 for Pandas

This repository should contain the 'Resources' folder with the two spreadsheets of data that were used, plus two files:
    1. The 'PyCitySchoolsHomework' Jupyter Source File that contains the code I created for this homework
    2. The 'Pandas Homework Observable Trends' document that contains a description of two trends I noticed from analyzing this data.
